# Booking Insurance API

This repository contains a small service used for booking and insurance matching.

## Quick start

Run the project with a single command:

```bash
npm run start:all
```

The command installs dependencies (if they are missing) and launches the development server.

## Run tests

```bash
npm run test
npm run test:e2e
```

## Verify test task

The simplest way to confirm your setup runs the tests correctly is to execute:

```bash
npm run test
```

You should see output ending with lines similar to:

```text
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       4 passed, 4 total
```

If every suite reports **passed**, the test task is functioning properly. For end-to-end validation run `npm run test:e2e` and ensure it completes without failures.
